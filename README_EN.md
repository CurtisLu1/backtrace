## Installation Process

1. Environment check:
   - System compatibility verification
   - Python environment detection
   - Required command check
2. Dependency installation:
   - fail2ban
   - Python virtualenv
   - Other required packages
3. Component configuration:
   - Cowrie honeypot (port 2222)
   - Fail2ban protection
   - Log cleanup (2 AM daily)
4. Security configuration:
   - SSH port configuration
   - Authentication method settings
   - Key management
   - Firewall rules

## Configuration Details

### Fail2ban Configuration
- Ban time: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- Detection window: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Max retry: 3 times
- Monitored logs: auth.log and cowrie.log

### SSH Configuration Options
- Port selection:
  - Keep existing port
  - Random port (10000-65535)
  - Manual specification (1024-65535)
- Authentication methods:
  - Keep existing configuration
  - Key-only authentication
  - Password + key authentication
- Key options:
  - Keep existing keys
  - Import new public key
  - Generate new key pair (4096-bit RSA)

### Firewall Settings
- Auto-configure SSH port
- Auto-configure honeypot port (2222)
- Smart rule management
- Optional UFW enablement
- Detailed rule processing:
  - Auto add/remove rules
  - Rule conflict detection
  - Rule priority management

## Log Management

### Log Locations
- Cowrie logs: `/opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/`
- Fail2ban logs: `/var/log/fail2ban.log`
- System logs: `/var/log/`
- Cleanup logs: `/var/log/cleanup.log`

### Log Rotation
- Weekly rotation
- Keep 4 versions
- Automatic compression
- Auto-cleanup of logs older than 30 days

## Configuration Backup

### Backup Strategy
- Location: `/root/config_backups/`
- Naming format: `configname.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bak`
- Retention: Keeps 3-5 most recent versions per config
- Auto cleanup: Removes expired backups

### Backed Up Configs
- SSH config: `sshd_config` backups
- Fail2ban config: `jail.local` backups
- Automatic backup before each config change
- Supports configuration rollback

### Backup Management

## Service Management

```bash
# Status check
systemctl status cowrie
systemctl status fail2ban
ufw status

# Log viewing
tail -f /opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log
journalctl -u cowrie -f
tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log

# Service control
systemctl start|stop|restart cowrie
systemctl start|stop|restart fail2ban
```

## Security Recommendations

1. After installation:
   - Save the displayed SSH port number
   - Backup generated SSH keys (if any)
   - Keep current session before testing new configuration
2. Firewall configuration:
   - Ensure necessary ports are open
   - Recommend enabling UFW
   - Regular firewall rule checks
3. Regular maintenance:
   - Regular system log checks
   - Monitor honeypot logs
   - Timely system updates

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Stop services
systemctl stop cowrie
systemctl disable cowrie

# Remove files
rm -rf /opt/cowrie
rm /etc/systemd/system/cowrie.service

# Reload systemd
systemctl daemon-reload
```
